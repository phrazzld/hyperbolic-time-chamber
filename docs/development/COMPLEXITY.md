# Code Complexity Analysis

This document describes the automated code complexity analysis system that helps maintain code quality and readability in the WorkoutTracker project.

## Overview

The complexity analysis system uses the [Lizard](https://github.com/terryyin/lizard) code complexity analyzer to automatically measure and report on code complexity metrics, helping identify functions that may be difficult to understand, test, or maintain.

## Metrics Measured

### Cyclomatic Complexity (CCN)
- **Definition**: Number of linearly independent paths through program code
- **Current Threshold**: 8 (reasonable for most functions)
- **Project Average**: 1.3 (excellent - very simple functions)

### Function Length (NLOC)
- **Definition**: Non-comment lines of code per function
- **Current Threshold**: 20 lines (encourages focused functions)
- **Project Maximum**: 15 lines (excellent)

### Parameter Count
- **Definition**: Number of parameters per function
- **Current Threshold**: 5 parameters (readability limit)
- **Project Maximum**: 3 parameters (excellent)

### File Size (NLOC)
- **Definition**: Non-comment lines of code per file
- **Current Threshold**: 100 lines (manageable file size)
- **Project Maximum**: 69 lines (excellent)

## Current Project Status

### Complexity Summary
- **Total NLOC**: 271 lines
- **Total Functions**: 15
- **Average Cyclomatic Complexity**: 1.3
- **Threshold Violations**: 0

### Function-Level Analysis

**Most Complex Functions:**
1. `DataStore.export` - CCN: 3, Length: 14 lines
2. `DataStore.init` - CCN: 2, Length: 9 lines  
3. `DataStore.load` - CCN: 2, Length: 8 lines
4. `DataStore.save` - CCN: 2, Length: 7 lines

**Largest Files:**
1. `AddEntryView.swift` - 69 NLOC
2. `HistoryView.swift` - 48 NLOC
3. `DataStore.swift` - 47 NLOC

All functions and files are well within acceptable complexity thresholds.

## Usage

### Local Analysis

```bash
# Run complete complexity analysis
./scripts/analyze-complexity.sh

# View reports
ls complexity/
open complexity/complexity-report.html  # Visual HTML report
```

### Generated Reports

1. **complexity-report.txt** - Command-line formatted report
2. **complexity-report.html** - Interactive HTML visualization
3. **complexity-report.json** - Machine-readable data
4. **complexity-report.csv** - Spreadsheet-compatible format
5. **analysis-summary.md** - Markdown summary with configuration
6. **complexity-summary.txt** - Human-readable executive summary

### CI Integration

The complexity analysis runs automatically:
- On every push and pull request
- Reports uploaded as CI artifacts (30-day retention)
- PR comments with complexity summaries
- Currently informational (no build failures)

## Thresholds & Configuration

### Current Thresholds
```bash
# Reasonable limits based on current codebase
MAX_CYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY=8     # Industry standard for maintainable code
MAX_FUNCTION_LENGTH=20          # Encourages focused, single-purpose functions
MAX_FUNCTION_PARAMETERS=5       # Readability and testing limit
MAX_NLOC_PER_FILE=100          # Manageable file size
```

### Rationale
- **Conservative but practical**: Set above current maximums to allow growth
- **Based on industry standards**: Align with established best practices
- **Testing-friendly**: Complex functions are harder to test thoroughly
- **Maintainability focus**: Simpler code is easier to understand and modify

## Benefits

### Code Quality
- **Early detection** of overly complex functions
- **Objective metrics** for code review discussions
- **Trending analysis** to track complexity growth over time

### Maintainability
- **Encourage refactoring** of complex functions
- **Promote SOLID principles** through function size limits
- **Support code reviews** with quantitative data

### Testing
- **Identify hard-to-test code** through complexity metrics
- **Guide test coverage priorities** to complex functions first
- **Support TDD practices** by catching complexity early

## Best Practices

### Function Design
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each function should do one thing well
2. **Small and Focused**: Aim for functions under 10 lines when possible
3. **Minimal Parameters**: Use objects or configuration structs for multiple parameters
4. **Extract Methods**: Break down complex logic into smaller, named functions

### Complexity Management
1. **Monitor Trends**: Watch for increasing complexity over time
2. **Refactor Proactively**: Address complexity before it becomes technical debt
3. **Review High-Complexity Code**: Give extra attention to functions near thresholds
4. **Document Complex Logic**: When complexity is necessary, document the reasoning

### Team Workflows
1. **Use in Code Reviews**: Reference complexity metrics in PR discussions
2. **Set Team Standards**: Agree on acceptable complexity levels
3. **Track Technical Debt**: Monitor complexity increases as potential debt
4. **Celebrate Simplicity**: Recognize efforts to reduce complexity

## Integration with Development Philosophy

### Alignment with Project Values
- **Testability First**: Complex functions are harder to test comprehensively
- **Explicit Design**: Simple functions make system behavior more obvious
- **Maintainability**: Lower complexity reduces long-term maintenance costs

### Supporting TDD
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Complexity analysis helps identify when to refactor
- **Test Design**: Complex functions often indicate insufficient test granularity
- **Confidence**: Simple functions are easier to test thoroughly

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Trend Analysis**: Track complexity changes over time
2. **Function Hotspots**: Identify frequently changed complex functions
3. **Complexity Budgets**: Allocate complexity allowances per module
4. **Automated Refactoring**: Suggest specific refactoring opportunities

### Threshold Evolution
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust based on project maturity
- **Component-Specific**: Different limits for UI vs. business logic
- **Team Agreements**: Collaboratively set and adjust standards

## Tools and Dependencies

### Core Tools
- **Lizard 1.17.31**: Primary complexity analyzer
- **Python 3.x**: Runtime environment
- **Jinja2**: HTML report template engine

### Installation
```bash
# Project setup (automated in CI)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install lizard jinja2
```

### Platform Support
- **macOS**: Native support (current development environment)
- **Linux**: Full compatibility
- **Windows**: Compatible with WSL/MSYS

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Virtual Environment**: Ensure Python venv is activated
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Install lizard and jinja2 via pip
3. **Permission Errors**: Ensure scripts have execute permissions
4. **Path Issues**: Run from project root directory

### Support
- Check existing GitHub issues for analysis problems
- Review CI logs for detailed error information
- Consult lizard documentation for advanced configuration options
