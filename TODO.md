## üö® URGENT: CI Pipeline Timeout Resolution

### Immediate CI Fixes (High Priority)
- [x] **Increase CI test timeout from 120s to 180s** - Tests are timing out at test 112/118, need more buffer time for CI environments
- [ ] **Enhance CI environment detection** - Replace `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["CI"]` with `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["GITHUB_ACTIONS"] == "true"` for more reliable detection  
- [ ] **Further reduce performance test dataset sizes** - Current CI optimizations (50-100 entries) still too large, reduce to 20-50 entries maximum
- [ ] **Skip #if !CI_BUILD tests in CI** - Ensure conditional compilation properly excludes stress tests in CI environments

### Performance Test Optimization (High Priority)  
- [ ] **Optimize LargeDatasetPerformanceTests execution time** - Tests 67-93 taking excessive time, need faster test data generation
- [ ] **Implement CI-specific test configuration** - Create separate test configs for CI vs local development
- [ ] **Add test execution monitoring** - Implement progress logging to identify which specific tests are slow
- [ ] **Consider test parallelization limits** - CI may need sequential execution instead of `--parallel` for large tests

### CI Infrastructure Improvements (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Add test timeout warnings at 90s** - Early warning system before 120s timeout
- [ ] **Implement test result caching** - Cache test results for unchanged code to speed up CI
- [ ] **Create CI performance benchmark** - Establish baseline metrics for acceptable CI execution times
- [ ] **Add memory usage monitoring** - Track memory consumption during CI test execution

## üìù Quality Gates (In Progress)

### Pre-commit Hooks (Pending)
- [ ] **Add Package.swift validation to pre-commit hook** - Prevent broken Swift package dependencies from being committed

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] **Update CLAUDE.md with CI troubleshooting guide** - Document timeout issues and resolution steps
- [ ] **Create CI optimization best practices** - Guidelines for test performance in CI environments

## üîß Technical Debt

### Test Architecture
- [ ] **Refactor performance tests structure** - Separate quick tests from comprehensive stress tests  
- [ ] **Create test utility functions** - Reduce code duplication in test data generation
- [ ] **Implement test categorization** - Mark tests by execution time (fast/medium/slow)

### Build System
- [ ] **Optimize Swift package resolution** - Reduce dependency resolution time in CI
- [ ] **Review test discovery performance** - Ensure test target compilation is efficient

---

## Notes
- CI currently failing at test execution step (112/118 tests completed before timeout)
- All builds and linting steps pass successfully
- Performance tests with datasets of 50-100 entries still too slow for CI
- Need aggressive optimization for GitHub Actions environment constraints
