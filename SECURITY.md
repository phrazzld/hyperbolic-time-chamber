# Security & Dependency Management

This document outlines the security practices and dependency management strategies for the WorkoutTracker project.

## Automated Security Scanning

### Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

The project includes automated dependency vulnerability scanning using our custom `scripts/check-dependencies.sh` script.

#### Features

- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Analyzes all Swift Package Manager dependencies
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Checks against known vulnerabilities
- **License Compliance**: Validates dependency licenses
- **JSON Reports**: Generates structured reports for tooling integration
- **CI Integration**: Runs automatically on all pushes and pull requests

#### Reports Generated

1. **dependency-report.json**: Complete dependency inventory
2. **vulnerability-report.json**: Known vulnerabilities and security advisories
3. **license-report.json**: License compliance status
4. **current-dependencies.txt**: Human-readable dependency tree

#### Usage

```bash
# Run security scan locally
./scripts/check-dependencies.sh

# View reports
ls security/
```

#### CI Integration

The security scan runs automatically in GitHub Actions:
- Executes on every push and pull request
- Uploads security reports as artifacts
- Comments vulnerability summary on pull requests
- Fails build if critical vulnerabilities detected (configurable)

### Dependabot Configuration

Automated dependency updates are configured via `.github/dependabot.yml`:

- **Schedule**: Weekly updates on Mondays at 9:00 AM EST
- **Grouping**: Related dependencies grouped together
- **Review**: All updates require manual review
- **Limits**: Maximum 5 Swift PRs, 3 GitHub Actions PRs

#### Dependency Groups

1. **test-dependencies**: Testing-related packages
2. **pointfree-dependencies**: Point-Free ecosystem packages

### Security Best Practices

#### Development

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit passwords, API keys, or tokens
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs at system boundaries
3. **Dependency Review**: Review all new dependencies before addition
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current with security patches

#### CI/CD

1. **Automated Scanning**: Every build includes security scans
2. **Report Retention**: Security reports retained for 30 days
3. **Threshold Enforcement**: Configurable security thresholds
4. **Audit Trail**: All security findings tracked in CI artifacts

## Current Security Status

### Dependencies (4 total)

- **swift-custom-dump** v1.3.3: No known vulnerabilities
- **swift-snapshot-testing** v1.18.4: No known vulnerabilities  
- **swift-syntax** v601.0.1: No known vulnerabilities
- **xctest-dynamic-overlay** v1.5.2: ⚠️ Security advisories found

### Vulnerability Assessment

The xctest-dynamic-overlay security advisory appears to be a false positive related to GitHub's security scanning. This is a testing-only dependency with no production impact.

**Risk Assessment**: LOW
- Testing dependency only
- No production code exposure
- Regular updates via Dependabot

### License Compliance

All dependencies use compatible open-source licenses:
- Point-Free packages: MIT-compatible
- Swift-syntax: Apache 2.0 compatible

## Security Configuration

### Scanning Thresholds

Currently configured for informational reporting. Future versions may include:
- CRITICAL: Block builds on critical vulnerabilities
- HIGH: Require security review
- MEDIUM/LOW: Track and monitor

### Report Retention

- **CI Artifacts**: 30 days
- **Local Reports**: Gitignored, not committed
- **Historical Data**: Available in CI build history

## Monitoring & Alerting

### GitHub Integration

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency PRs
- **Security Advisories**: GitHub native vulnerability alerts
- **CI Comments**: PR-level security summaries

### Future Enhancements

- Slack/email notifications for critical vulnerabilities
- Integration with security dashboard
- Automated patching for low-risk updates
- SLA tracking for vulnerability remediation

## Incident Response

### Vulnerability Discovery

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and risk level
2. **Patching**: Update to patched version if available
3. **Mitigation**: Implement workarounds if no patch available
4. **Documentation**: Update security status and communicate findings

### Contact

For security concerns or vulnerability reports, please:
1. Check existing GitHub Security Advisories
2. Review CI security scan results
3. Contact repository maintainers for critical issues
